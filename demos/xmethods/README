This readme is for running demos using Personal Java.

Currently the only two demos working with Personal Java are:
	pjtemperature/Temperature
	pjtraffic/Traffic

1.  These tests will only work in Solaris or Win32, as Sun is only offering their emulator on these two platforms.  No word on a Linux release as of yet.

2.  Download the Personal Java Emulator from java.sun.com
3.  Add $Personal_Java_Home/bin in your path so the java compiler can find it
4.  Add the following directories, jar files to your classpath:
	$WINGFOOT_SRC/extern/kxml1-1_20.jar
	$WINGFOOT_SRC/soap/build/lib/j2sewsoap_0.90.jar
	
5.  Change directories to your demo directory
6.  Compile the classes using javac
7.  Run the classes using Personal Java in the following fashion:
	pjava xmethods.pjtemperature.Temperature <zipcode>
	pjava xmethods.pjtemperature.Traffic <highway_number>

8.  The results will show up in your console.


*enjoy these little tests that I wrote.

[1] Google Search Midlet
  
    The Google search midlet uses Google's Web APIs to perform web searches.
    
    1.1 Obtaining the Google license

    Before building the midlet from the source code, you need to obtain a
    license key from Google. This involves creating a Google account at
    http://www.google.com/apis/.
    This license key allows you to perform 1000 automated searches in day.

    Once you have obtained the license key, edit the Google.java class and
    update the constant GOOGLE_KEY with the key that you have obtained.

    e.g. if the key you have obtained is "GNtDPzzEzyEiXsi2p4H4hlPAi06PW52U",
    update GOOGLE_KEY as shown:

    private final static String GOOGLE_KEY = "GNtDPzzEzyEiXsi2p4H4hlPAi06PW52U";

    1.2 Installation
    	
    The Google search midlet can be used on any CLDC device, Palm Emulator and
    the J2ME Tool Kit.
    	The following are included with this package:
	1.  Source Files - these are contained in the src directory
	2.  PRC file for the Palm OS - this is contained in the bin directory
	3.  JAR and JAD file - this is contained in the bin directory
	
    1.3 Compiling

    In order to compile the Google search midlet, the following are required:
    	1.  kvmwsoap_xml_1_0.jar or j2sewsoap_xml_1_0.jar
